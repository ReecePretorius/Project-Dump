# Stock Span Problem

The span of a stockâ€™s price on a certain day is the maximum number of consecutive days (up to and including the current day) 
that the price of the stock has been less than or equal to its price of that day. 
Stock.java takes an array 'P' of stock prices such that P[i] is the price of a stock on day i, and calculates the span for each day.
